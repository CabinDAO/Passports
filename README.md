## Background: Why NFTs for Membership?

Every community in the Web 3 space has it's own way of implementing membership.
Social DAOs like FWB use a fungible token (ERC-20) to token-gate their community
while NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club do so with their ERC-721,
non-fungible token. As we outlined in our article, *[Unbundling social token
economics, governance, and
access](https://creators.mirror.xyz/V7Ucba89-3qV9yFxj7Spj7YxjKAhc6TOd8nUcCp9n6k)*,
we believe that every DAO and Web 3 community needs to decide how fungible their
membership is and make the appropriate technical decision to implement it as an
ERC-20 or an ERC-721.

There are plenty of tools for implementing membership and token-gating based on
an ERC-20, but very few (if any) for doing so with an ERC-721. The goal of
Passports.xyz is to provide a tool for easily minting NFTs that can be used for
this kind of token-gating.
